## Navigating
Use the Up and Down arrow keys to move up and down a line respectively. 

Pressing 'Enter' moves down a line and creates a new line when pressed on the last line.

## Inputting a proof
### Statements
In the statement section you can type in a statement using variables and <a href="#op">operators</a>. 
- If the inputted statement is correct, the background of that line will turn green. 
- If the inputted statement is incorrect (does not match <a href="#rules">rule</a>), the background of that line will turn red.
- If the inputted statement is invalid (statement format not obeyed), the background of that line will turn dark red.

Inputting the '|' character will start a new sub proof and deleting it will exit the subproof.

### Inputting <a href="#rules">Rules</a>
A rule consists of two parts: The arguments and the rule itself.

> #### Arguments
- \<line>, \<line>,... - Inputting individual lines
- \<line>-\<line> - Inputting range of lines 

> #### <a href="#rules">Rules</a>
Rules can be chosen using the drop down on the far right of the line. 

## Importing and Exporting
In the menu bar at the top of the application, under 'File' there are the options to Import and Export files.

Exported files are in .txt format. It is possible to modify the exported proof text file, however, it is not recommended.
